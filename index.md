# Whitewater GIS

Whitewater is hard to find...even when it is easy. Whitewater rivers occur where gradient and precipitation intersect and flow downhill. It should come as little surprise many whitewater paddlers have a fair working knowledge of maps, orienteering and GPS. Many (myself included), also know a decent amount about four wheel drive vehicles and get excited about things like big knobby tires. After all, whitewater rivers are not easy to get to so big trucks can make it easier to get to whitewater. Still, there really is no comprehensive and authoritative mapping data source for whitewater in the United States. This is why Whitewater GIS exists, to fill this gap.
